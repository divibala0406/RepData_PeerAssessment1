##Loading and preprocessing data
##Download, unzip and load data into data frame data

```{r Downloading and Reading Data}
library(knitr)
library(markdown)

if(!file.exists("getdata-projectfiles-UCI HAR Dataset.zip")) {
        temp <- tempfile()
        download.file("http://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fdata%2Factivity.zip",temp)
        unzip(temp)
        unlink(temp)
}

data <- read.csv("activity.csv")

```

###Adding total number of steps per day and creating histogram

```{r Histogram plot}

steps_by_day <- aggregate(steps ~ date, data, sum)
hist(steps_by_day$steps, main = paste("Total Steps Each Day"), col="pink", xlab="Number of Steps")

```

###Calculating the "mean" and "median" for the total steps per day

```{r Compute Mean and Median}
rmean <- mean(steps_by_day$steps)
rmedian <- median(steps_by_day$steps)
```

###The mean is `r rmean`.

###the median is `r rmedian`.

###What is the average daily activity pattern?

###Calculate average steps for each interval for all days.
###Plot the Average Number Steps per Day by Interval.


```{r Line plot}
steps_by_interval <- aggregate(steps ~ interval, data, mean)

plot(steps_by_interval$interval,steps_by_interval$steps, type="l", xlab="Interval", ylab="Number of Steps",main="Average Number of Steps per Day by Interval")
```

###Find interval with most average steps.

```{r Find interval with the most average steps}
max_interval <- steps_by_interval[which.max(steps_by_interval$steps),1]
```

###The 5-minute interval, on average across all the days in the data set, containing the maximum number of steps is `r max_interval`.

###Input missing values. Compare data "after input missing values" to "non-input missing values".

###Missing data needed to be inputed. Missing values were inputed by inserting the average for each interval. 

```{r input missing data}
incomplete <- sum(!complete.cases(data))
inputed_data <- transform(data, steps = ifelse(is.na(data$steps), steps_by_interval$steps[match(data$interval, steps_by_interval$interval)], data$steps))
```

###Zeroes were inputed for 10-01-2012 because it was the first day and would have been over 9,000 steps higher than the following day, which had only 126 steps. NAs then were assumed to be zeros to fit the rising trend of the data.

```{r input 0 for 10-01-2012}
inputed_data[as.character(inputed_data$date) == "2012-10-01", 1] <- 0
```

###Recount total steps by day and create Histogram.

```{r create new histogram plot}
steps_by_day_i <- aggregate(steps ~ date, inputed_data, sum)
hist(steps_by_day_i$steps, main = paste("Total Steps Each Day"), col="pink", xlab="Number of Steps")

#Create Histogram to show difference. 
hist(steps_by_day$steps, main = paste("Total Steps Each Day"), col="blue", xlab="Number of Steps", add=T)
legend("topright", c("Inputed", "Non-inputed"), col=c("pink", "blue"), lwd=8)
```


###Calculate new mean and median for inputed data.

```{r compute new mean and median}
rmean.i <- mean(steps_by_day_i$steps)
rmedian.i <- median(steps_by_day_i$steps)
```

###Calculate difference between inputed (for missing value) and non-inputed data.

```{r compute differnece between inputed missing value and non-inputed}
mean_diff <- rmean.i - rmean
med_diff <- rmedian.i - rmedian
```

###Calculate total difference.

```{r toatl differnce}
total_diff <- sum(steps_by_day_i$steps) - sum(steps_by_day$steps)
```


###The inputed data mean is `r rmean.i`.

###The inputed data median is `r rmedian.i`.

###The difference between the non-inputed mean and inputed mean is `r mean_diff`.

###The difference between the non-inputed mean and inputed mean is `r med_diff`.

###The difference between total number of steps between inputed and non-inputed data is `r total_diff`. Thus, there were `r total_diff` more steps in the inputed data.

###Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?

###Create a plot to compare and contrast number of steps between the week and weekend. There is a higher peak earlier on weekdays, and more overall activity on weekends.

```{r plot to compare and contrast between weekdays and weekend}
weekdays <- c("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", 
              "Friday")
inputed_data$dow = as.factor(ifelse(is.element(weekdays(as.Date(inputed_data$date)),weekdays), "Weekday", "Weekend"))

steps_by_interval_i <- aggregate(steps ~ interval + dow, inputed_data, mean)

library(lattice)

xyplot(steps_by_interval_i$steps ~ steps_by_interval_i$interval|steps_by_interval_i$dow, main="Average Steps per Day by Interval",xlab="Interval", ylab="Steps",layout=c(2,1), type="l")
```
